      <p>
        Needs-based communication (usually called non-violent communication or
        NVC™) is a way of understanding yourself and others with a unique
        insight: everyone has their own personal reactions to the world, but
        people have the same basic needs. We recognize those needs in other
        people, and that common connection can allow us to communicate clearly
        when there is conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Needs</strong> are universal to humanity. They are common drives
        that we all experience, and this universality makes them perfect for
        connecting with each other. Some broad categories of needs are the needs
        for: connection, physical well-being, honesty, play, peace, autonomy,
        and meaning. Needs can also be specific: a need for clarity, nurturing,
        integrity, trust, space, etc. Needs are abstract, not connected to
        people or actions. For example, peace is a need, muting TV commercials
        is not. Here is
        <a
          href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >a partial list of needs</a
        >
        from the Center for Non-Violent Communication (CNVC).
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything <em>anyone</em> does is an attempt to meet a need. None of
        these universal needs is wrong or inherently harmful, although sometimes
        the strategies we use can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Conflict</strong> happens when our needs aren’t met. We get
        stuck in conflict when we mix up needs and strategies. Needs never
        conflict with each other, only strategies do.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we experience conflict or negative feelings, that indicates that
        there is an unmet need. In an attempt to end a conflict, we often settle
        on unsatisfying resolutions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          We suppress the need and move on, painfully leaving the problem
          unaddressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          We come to an uneasy agreement about who is the winner and who is the
          loser, and the loser gives up on meeting their need. The immediate
          conflict is over, but the problem is not really resolved.
        </li>
        <li>
          We escalate, expanding the conflict in an attempt to win, at the
          other’s expense if necessary.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These resolutions can happen despite our best intentions, as a result of
        not understanding what’s happening as we fight. A very common mistake is
        to confuse needs and strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Strategies</strong> are things we do to meet our needs. In
        contrast to needs, which are abstract and universal, strategies are
        personal, specific, and widely varied.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider the need for self-expression. There are as many
        strategies as there are people and situations: singing, writing,
        talking, composing, dressing a certain way… and on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jumping into a conflict strategy-first is bound to cause problems if
        that strategy doesn’t meet others’ needs as well as your own. The way
        past conflict is for everyone involved to understand each others’ needs,
        and <em>then</em> work together to find a strategy to meet those needs.
      </p>
      <p>So, <strong>how do you figure out your own needs?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Negative feelings are a sign that you have an unmet need. Unfortunately,
        most of us have learned to bundle in certain judgments and name them as
        feelings. For example, I might think I am feeling <em>abandoned</em>,
        but really this is a feeling of disconnectedness, vulnerability,
        loneliness, or something else, combined with a judgment that someone
        else has made me feel that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is that the same situation can affect people very differently.
        This means that feelings must come from a person’s own response to
        things. In order to see your feelings clearly, it is important to take
        ownership of them as <em>your</em> feelings rather than something caused
        by the world around you. I have found this to be very challenging, but
        also incredibly rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have an honest name for what you are feeling, think about what
        need sparked the feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a (kind of clunky) formula for requesting help meeting a need
        without tacking on strategies, demands, judgments, or other baggage. As
        the exercise becomes more habitual, you won’t need the formula, and can
        accomplish the same thing more naturally.
      </p>
      <p>Here it is:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          When <em>[observation]</em>, I felt <em>[feeling]</em> because I was
          having a need for <em>[need]</em>. (possibly also a request:) Are you
          willing to <em>[action]</em>?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In the spirit of communicating without judgments, the observation should
        be strictly focused on facts, with no mind-reading or attribution at
        all. Sharing your feelings in addition to the need can help the other
        person recognize the need and how it affects you. If the other person
        understands the need, you can also make a request for some specific
        action to help meet your need.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very important that the action you request be feasible, concrete,
        and specific. Asking someone to change their behavior forever, think a
        certain way, etc is too much. The request should also really, truly be a
        request and not a demand. A “No!” should be as welcome as a “Yes!”
        because the goal is to find a strategy that meets your needs
        <em>and</em> theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a (similarly clunky) pattern for discovering someone else’s
        needs. As you listen to them, you will probably get an idea for how they
        feel, and you may be able to guess what need they are experiencing. You
        can ask:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          When you <em>[observation]</em> do you feel <em>[feeling]</em> because
          you are having a need for <em>[need]</em>? (possibly also:) Right now,
          would you like me to <em>[action]</em>?
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Like the other formula, this is just a beginning point, almost too rough
        to use except for training your responses and replacing old
        communication habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are two sides of the same coin, a pattern that draws a line from
        the stimulus, some observation, through the needs, towards a solution.
        Even if you guess wrong, just focusing on someone’s feelings and needs
        demonstrates that you are really interested in their problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even without explicitly using this pattern (observation ➔ feeling ➔ need
        ➔ request), just by thinking about needs (your own and others’) you can
        untangle conflict and see other people with much more empathy. Maybe
        that reckless driver is having a need for excitement and power, and
        zipping around you was the best strategy they could come up with. Just
        seeing past the image of others as enemies or obstacles can make the
        world much less hostile, by revealing them to be real humans, people you
        might be able to connect with. This way of thinking can also be a path
        to growth as you take ownership of your feelings and see your needs
        clearly.
