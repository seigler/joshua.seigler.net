      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Gibbs has a point. The modern vision of a utopian future is one where
        work is relieved, and people are free to pursue leisure, or exercise
        their creativity with art, writing, and poetry. Thinking computers are
        here now, in the form of ‚Äúlarge language models‚Äù (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
        Setting aside the irony that creative works are the first and most
        visible applications of LLM technology ‚Äì is that imagined future
        actually a good one?

        Mom is always right
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I was a kid, I remember a day going to yard sales with my mom in
        the family minivan. It was early summer, a hot day. The windows were
        down, and I complained that if the vehicle has good air conditioning, we
        should use it. What was the point in getting all hot? ‚ÄúTo get used to
        the warm weather,‚Äù came the answer. What an injustice! We were sweating
        back there! Later in life, I took a short trip to Arizona in August.
        Everyone scurried from building to building. Where the sun was doubled,
        reflected off of glass skyscrapers, the temperature jump was alarming.
        It was actually unsafe to spend long stretches outside unprepared. But
        when I returned to Massachusetts, for the rest of the summer 85 or 90
        degrees Fahrenheit felt like nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that to say, the work that LLM technology offers to relieve isn‚Äôt
        just about achieving a result. The effort maintains and builds our
        abilities. Work pushes us to connect to each other for help, or to
        persevere in doing something difficult. Outsourcing that work eventually
        means losing the ability to do it yourself.
      </p>
      <h2 id="attention-must-be-paid" tabindex="-1">
        <a
          class="header-anchor"
          href="#attention-must-be-paid"
          aria-hidden="true"
        ></a>
        Attention must be paid
      </h2>
      <p>
        Simply put, an LLM is a document completion engine. You give it text,
        and it extends it. The result doesn‚Äôt have to be true, it just has to be
        convincing. No amount of pre-training or guard rails will make it
        truthful. It does often say true things, but that‚Äôs not the point, it‚Äôs
        more of a happy accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because they are built from essentially the whole public internet, LLMs
        also have a strong connection to The Algorithm. Algorithms that run
        social media feeds and online advertising are designed to attract human
        attention, a precious thing. Social media algorithms and LLMs are
        oriented towards capturing that attention. The foundational LLM paper is
        even called, ‚ÄúAttention is all you need‚Äù. A prescient title. LLM
        intelligence is not like ours. It can‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be a
        human.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this was a person, someone who wanted your attention and had this
        kind of indifference towards truth, they would be considered a con-man
        or bullshitter.

        LLMs clearly manifest a type of intelligence. Sure, it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù some
        linear algebra and a ton of data. But it does exhibit a type of
        intelligence. One without empathy.

        Science fiction is littered with cautionary tales about inhuman
        intelligence. For that matter, so is myth: genies give people whatever
        they want, but because people have self-destructive desires (like the
        desire to avoid work), it goes wrong. In TRON, Infocom has the MCP
        (Master Control Program), an overgrown chess program that is given
        access to whatever information it can consume, until its intelligence
        and capabilities are seemingly endless. The company leadership comes to
        rely on the program so completely that it becomes their entire interface
        for understanding and operating the business. There is also the irony
        that Infocom‚Äôs success was built on the misuse of intellectual property,
        much as LLM companies have done

        I don‚Äôt think I am wise enough to safely use a genie in a bottle. And I
        don‚Äôt want to outsource my creative efforts to an addictive,
        bullshitting alien intellect, even if it might save time and effort in
        the short term.
