Since then I have found it to be everything I was looking for, and a great deal more. There is such a wealth of wisdom, going back thousands of years. And it was all there, un-seen, un-read, as far as I was concerned not existing at all! It seems impossible to me that I was so unaware of these treasures by chance.</p><p>Father Seraphim Rose, Saint Paisios, Saint Porphyrios, Elder Thaddeus of Vitovnica - to name only a few! - lived in this world, recently. They speak plainly and lovingly about modern and familiar concerns. Their example and guidance are a priceless treasure! And not only they help me, but participating in the tradition of the Orthodox Church has… I don’t even know how to say it all. I have experienced how the prodigal son felt when he took a few trembling steps back to his father, and instead of the rejection or anger he had earned, he received joyful, unearned forgiveness. His father <em>ran</em> to him while he was still far away!</p><p>Here is what I know, now from experience: Jesus Christ is life and truth and love. To look for life, or truth, or love apart from Him is pointless! It’s a contradiction, like looking for light by marching into the shadows. God made me, and He loves me more than I love myself. Because this is true, I want to do everything His way, even if I don’t understand it at first.</p></main><script data-isso="//comments.apps.seigler.net/" src="//comments.apps.seigler.net/js/embed.min.js"></script><section id="isso-thread" data-title=""><noscript>Javascript needs to be activated to view comments.</noscript></section><footer>&copy; Joshua Seigler 2025. - <a rel="me" href="mailto:joshua@seigler.net?subject=Hello">Contact</a> - <a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a> - <a href="/unoffice-hours/">Unoffice Hours</a> - <a href="/webrings/">Webrings</a></footer><div id="effects"></div></body></html>
