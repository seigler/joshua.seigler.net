      <p>
        Around the time of my previous post, I had just been received into the
        Orthodox church. Since then I have found it to be everything I was
        looking for, and a great deal more. There is such a wealth of wisdom,
        going back thousands of years. And it was all there, un-seen, un-read,
        as far as I was concerned not existing at all! It seems impossible to me
        that I was so unaware of these treasures by chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Father Seraphim Rose, Saint Paisios, Saint Porphyrios, Elder Thaddeus of
        Vitovnica - to name only a few! - lived in this world, recently. They
        speak plainly and lovingly about modern and familiar concerns. Their
        example and guidance are a priceless treasure! And not only they help
        me, but participating in the tradition of the Orthodox Church has‚Ä¶ I
        don‚Äôt even know how to say it all. I have experienced how the prodigal
        son felt when he took a few trembling steps back to his father, and
        instead of the rejection or anger he had earned, he received joyful,
        unearned forgiveness. His father <em>ran</em> to him while he was still
        far away!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is what I know, now from experience: Jesus Christ is life and truth
        and love. To look for life, or truth, or love apart from Him is
        pointless! It‚Äôs a contradiction, like looking for light by marching into
        the shadows. God made me, and He loves me more than I love myself.
        Because this is true, I want to do everything His way, even if I don‚Äôt
        understand it at first.
      </p>
