I'm Joshua Seigler, a homeschooled kid born in the 80s. I've watched technology advance from dial-up and Geocities pages, to federated social media and decentralized autonomous organizations.

After a period exploring cryptocurrencies and building web development skills, I dove into political philosophy, focusing on economics, conspiracy, and truth-seeking generally.

In an effort to make sense of the tremendous social shifts that occurred in 2019/2020, I started learning about symbolism and mysticism, trying to escape an obsolete materialistic mindset. In 2021 I returned to faith in Jesus and joined an Eastern Orthodox church.

If you would like to reach me, you can [send me electronic mail](mailto:joshua@seigler.net?subject=found+your+website). Or for a closer look at my professional history, try my [timeline](/timeline).
