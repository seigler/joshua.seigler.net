I'm Joshua Seigler, a homeschooled kid born in the 80s. I've watched technology advance from dial-up and Geocities pages, to federated social media and decentralized autonomous organizations.

I am currently looking for a new software engineering role! I have fifteen years of engineering experience, with a specialization in front-end development for web and mobile. See [my professional timeline](/timeline) for more information.

If you would like to reach me, you can [send me electronic mail](mailto:joshua@seigler.net?subject=found+your+website) or [book an "unoffice hours" chat](https://appointments.apps.seigler.net)<sup>[?](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours)</sup>
