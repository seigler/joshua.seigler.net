I'm Joshua Seigler, a software engineer since 2010 and a living being since the 1980s. I've watched technology advance from dial-up and Geocities pages, to federated social media and decentralized autonomous organizations.

I currently work for a risk analysis startup called [QI Path](https://www.qipath.com/). My professional focus is on front-end development for web and mobile. See [/about](/about) for more detail.

I would love to connect: [send me electronic mail](mailto:joshua@seigler.net?subject=found+your+website) or [drop in my unoffice hours](/unoffice-hours).
