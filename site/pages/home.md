I'm Joshua Seigler, a homeschooled kid born in the 80s. I've watched technology advance from dial-up and Geocities pages, to federated social media and decentralized autonomous organizations.

At the moment I work for a risk analysis startup called QI Path. I have been a software engineer since 2010, and my focus has been on front-end development for web and mobile. See [my professional timeline](/timeline) for more information.
