I'm Joshua Seigler, a homeschooled kid born in the 80s. I've watched technology advance from dial-up and Geocities pages, to federated social media and decentralized autonomous organizations.

After a period exploring cryptocurrencies and building web development skills, I dove into political philosophy, focusing on economics, conspiracy, and truth-seeking generally.

In an effort to make sense of the tremendous social shifts that occurred in 2019/2020, I started researching mysticism, trying to escape an outdated materialistic mindset. In 2021 I joined the Eastern Orthodox church and finally found Truth.

I work remotely for a San Francisco startup called Capabuild, making web and mobile software for disaster recovery companies.
