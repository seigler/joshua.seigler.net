I'm Joshua Seigler, a software engineer since 2010 and a living being since the 1980s. I've watched technology advance from dial-up and Geocities pages, to federated social media and decentralized autonomous organizations.

I currently work for a risk analysis startup called QI Path. My professional focus is on front-end development for web and mobile. See [/about](/about) for more detail.

If you'd like to connect, [send me electronic mail](mailto:joshua@seigler.net?subject=found+your+website) or [schedule a video chat](/unoffice-hours).
