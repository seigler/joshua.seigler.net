I live in Southbridge, Massachusetts since 2022, with my wife Sara and our three cats. We're starting to get more integrated here. I'm about to start a new role, my third or fourth startup depending on how you count it. I'm active in [a local church](https://www.stmichaelorthodox.com/). I recently changed my mind about olives (I like them now).

## Goals

- Learn to love God and to love people. Simple but difficult, gradual.
- Drive success at my new job.
- Improve my back-end and infrastructure skills to eventually own the "full-stack" label.
- Build a passive income stream.
- Explore non-tech career skills, in case the world gets even wierder than it is today.
- Participate in communities:
  - Initiate and maintain connections with people around me (local community, neighbors, etc).
  - Connect with other web and software developers.
