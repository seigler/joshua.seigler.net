Working remotely has a lot of benefits, but we miss out on the serendipitous connections and socialization that happened just from being in the same room. Unoffice hours is part of an attempt to make new connections, but without applying the giant invisible filter of my own preferences.

If you want to talk about pretty much anything, [book 30 minutes on my calendar](https://appointments.apps.seigler.net/?service=1).

We could do some pair programming, talk about tech, life, matters of aesthetics or philosophy - the point is serendipity.
