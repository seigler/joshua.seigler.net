Working remotely has a lot of benefits, but we miss out on the serendipitous connections and socialization that happened just from being in the same room. Unoffice hours is part of an attempt to make new connections, but without applying the giant invisible filter of my own preferences.

We could do some pair programming, talk about tech, life, matters of aesthetics or philosophy - the point is serendipity. If you want to call with no agenda, that's fine too, we can just get to know each other.

The idea of unoffice hours comes from [Matt Webb](https://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/24/unoffice_hours). This site is part of an [Unoffice Hours Webring](https://unofficehours.com/) with other bloggers who have picked it up.
