## Hardware
- Lenovo LOQ laptop (personal), Framework laptop (work).

- Google Pixel 8 phone.

- Wide IKEA GALANT desk (discontinued).

- [65" curved 4k TV](https://www.zkelectronics.com/tv/samsung-qn65q7camfxza/), attached to the wall 1ft behind the desk so the image fills my field of view and 96dpi text is comfortable to read.

- [Unitek KVM switch](https://amzn.to/3FEyxSs) to swap which laptop is "live".

- [MOKOSE CS-lens 4k webcam](https://amzn.to/3FMLbyG) next to the TV for meetings.

- [High-output LED light](https://amzn.to/4kUm2ku) in an [IKEA REGOLIT shade](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/regolit-pendant-lamp-shade-white-handmade-70103410/) for mood regulation and for the webcam.

- [USB microphone with boom](https://amzn.to/4lgbwob).

- [Sony WH1000XM2 headphones](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/wireless-headphones-bluetooth-headphones/wh-1000xm2/specifications).

- TOSLINK-to-bluetooth adapter, so headphones get HDMI audio passed through from the TV.
