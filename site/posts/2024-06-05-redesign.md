New design! The tools I used before have a lot of unmaintained or outdated dependencies and I wanted something a little simpler. The new site uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/). Content is still in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

One thing I'm proud of is a visual ping for footnotes.^[It highlights when you click back, too.] When you click a footnote^[Hi.] it briefly highlights the thing you jumped to.

In the upper right I added a style toggle that applies the font from Star Wars, "Aurebesh". I learned how to read it but sometimes want some practice. <span data-language="aurebesh">People who can read this are cool and I like them.</span>

I also finally made a section for recipes!

> May 2025 edit: I updated the design some more without changing the tech stack. The main improvements are animated clouds and a host of minor adjustments.

> June 2025 edit: I have continued to alter the design. Pray I don't alter it any further.
