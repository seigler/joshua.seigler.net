  "Calculus with Analytic Geometry I". I showed my teacher a Newton's method root-finder program I made for my TI-83 calculator, and at the end of class she surprised me by having me demonstrate it to the class. When I asked why she hadn't given me any warning, she asked, "Would that have made you less nervous?"
