title: Founding software engineer @ [Capabuild](https://www.capabuild.app/)
time: 2022-2025
description: |
  Capabuild is a web and mobile platform for disaster recovery companies. This role was an unexpectedly great fit for some technologies I used in side projects: THREE.js and SVG. Here I worked with other experienced engineers building new things and continuously balancing speed and sustainability. Startup life is exciting! Priorities can change quickly, and in this role I could see every day how my work and execution could help our customers, and ultimately make the business a success. In this role I learned to accept and also pay down tech debt, and experienced the value of investing time into a good development environment.
