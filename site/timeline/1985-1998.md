  Reading, field trips, spelling bees. Developing interest in math, art, and computers. As long as I stayed ahead of the baseline public school standards, I could explore whatever interested me. What a great beginning.
  Big thanks to my parents for nurturing my appetite for learning. Thanks also to my brothers for teaching me patience and conflict resolution!
