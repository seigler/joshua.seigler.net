title: Senior software engineer @ Prenda
time: 2021-2022
description: |
  This role was at the intersection of many interests, including learning, communication, and decentralized solutions. Here I learned to own, plan, and solve larger and less-well-defined tasks. Prenda has an excellent and intentional culture that fosters humility and recognizes others' humanity.
