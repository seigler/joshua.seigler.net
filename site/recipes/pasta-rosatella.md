## Ingredients

- 1lb any pasta
- 2 cups (approximate) garlic & herb pasta sauce
- 1½ cups milk
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Salt and pepper
- Grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Boil salted water for pasta. Have the pasta ready to cook according to the box directions.
2. Meanwhile in a saucepan, whisk together the oil and flour over medium heat to form a roux. Cook for 1–2 minutes until lightly golden.
3. Slowly whisk in the milk and continue stirring until thickened.
4. Season with salt, pepper, and Parmesan until it tastes like a simple Alfredo sauce.
5. Stir in the can of pasta sauce and let the mixture simmer on low.
6. When the pasta is done cooking, drain, then top with the rosatella sauce and extra Parmesan to serve.

## Notes

The recipe works the same with almond milk and vegan mozarella replacing the existing dairy.
