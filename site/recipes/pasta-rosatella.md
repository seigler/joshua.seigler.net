## Ingredients

- 1lb any pasta
- 2 cups (approximate) garlic & herb pasta sauce
- 1½ cups milk
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 tablespoons oil
- Salt and pepper
- Grated Parmesan cheese

## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta according to the package directions.
2. Meanwhile in a saucepan, whisk together the oil and flour over medium heat to form a roux. Cook for 1–2 minutes until lightly golden.
3. Slowly whisk in the milk to make a béchamel and continue stirring until thickened.
4. Season with salt and pepper, and add cheese.
5. Stir in the pasta sauce and let the mixture simmer on low.
6. When the pasta is done cooking, drain it, then top with the sauce and extra cheese to serve.

## Notes

The recipe works the same with almond milk and vegan mozarella replacing the existing dairy.
