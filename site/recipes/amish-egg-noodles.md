title: Amish Egg Noodles
description: easy chicken-noodle style dish with egg noodles and butter
---

### Ingredients
- 6 tablespoons butter, divided
- 28 ounces chicken broth
- 1 chicken bouillon cube
- 12 ounces extra wide egg noodles
- 1 teaspoon parsley flakes
- Salt and pepper, to taste
### Instructions
- In a large pan, brown two tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
- Pour the chicken stock and bouillon cube into the pan and bring to a boil.
- Add the egg noodles to the chicken stock and return to a boil. Cover the pot and remove from the heat.
- Let the noodles set for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so.
- Test the noodles for doneness. If they are not cooked through, turn the heat back on and cook for 1-2 minutes until noodles are tender.
- Top with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
- Serve immediately or leave in the pan, covered, until ready to serve. These will stay warm for 20 more minutes or so with no problems.

### Notes:
We use 4.5 tsp of Better than Bullion with 28oz water, replacing the broth and bullion cube.
We also usually brown some canned chicken and add it at the same time as the butter and seasonings.
