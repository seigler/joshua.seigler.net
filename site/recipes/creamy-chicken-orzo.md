## Ingredients
- 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts, cooked and diced
- 8 ounces Orzo pasta
- 2 celery stalks, finely diced
- 2 carrots, finely diced
- 1/2 yellow onion, finely diced
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 cups chicken broth
- ½ cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder
- 1/3 cup all purpose flour

## Instructions

1. Cook the Orzo per the package instructions.
2. While that cooks, make a mirepoix:
    1. In a large skillet over medium high heat add the butter and olive oil.
    2. Once the butter is melted add in the diced onion, carrots and celery.
    3. Allow the veggies to sauté for 4-5 minutes until they start to soften up.
3.  Reduce the heat to low and sprinkle the all-purpose flour over the veggies and whisk together until it forms a paste/roux. While stirring constantly, allow the roux to cook for 2-3 minutes.
4. Pour into the roux the chicken broth, chicken boullion powder, and heavy whipping cream. Whisk together until no clumps are present and the mixture starts to thicken.
5. Add in the diced chicken and allow the mixture to simmer until it reaches desired thickness. Pour in drained orzo and stir to combine. Serve & enjoy!

## Notes

You can use rotisserie chicken or cook your own chicken for this recipe. If you use a rotisserie chicken then no additional seasonings are needed, but if you are planning to cook your own chicken then you will need to season it to your liking. I typically use a blend of onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and black pepper.
