## Ingredients

- 1 can of corn drained
- 1 can of creamed corn
- 1 stick melted butter 1/2 cup
- 1 box of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix
- 1 cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a bowl, mix all of the ingredients together in order, then pour into a greased 8"x8" baking pan.
3. Cook uncovered for 45-50 minutes or until lightly browned.

## Notes

Vegan substitutions: almond milk instead of sour cream, vegetable butter or neutral oil instead of butter. Made this way, the result will be less bready but still excellent. Increase cooking time slightly.

Doubling: if the pan size makes the uncooked mix more than about an inch deep, you will need extra cooking time. Cover it with foil and cook another 20 minutes or so.
