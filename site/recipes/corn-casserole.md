title: Corn Casserole
description: An easy sweet cornbread casserole with a vegan variation
---

## Ingredients

- 2 cans of corn, drained
- 2 cans of creamed corn
- 2 cups sour cream
- 2 stick melted butter (1 cup)
- 16 oz cornbread mix

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
1. In a bowl, mix all of the ingredients together, adding the corn last.
1. Pour into an 9"x13" baking pan.
1. Cook uncovered for 45-50 minutes or until lightly browned.

## Notes

Vegan substitutions: almond milk instead of sour cream, vegetable butter or neutral oil instead of butter. Made this way, the result will be less bready but still excellent. Extend cooking time slightly.
