title: Corn Casserole
description: An easy sweet cornbread casserole with a vegan variation
---

## Ingredients

- 1 can of corn drained
- 1 can of creamed corn
- 1 stick melted butter 1/2 cup
- 1 box of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix
- 1 cup sour cream

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a bowl, mix all of the ingredients together in order, then pour into a greased 8"x8" baking pan.
3. Cook uncovered for 45-50 minutes or until lightly browned.

## Notes

Vegan substitutions: almond milk instead of sour cream, vegetable butter or neutral oil instead of butter. Made this way, the result will be less bready but still excellent. Increase cooking time slightly.
