Serves six. Prep 20 minutes, cooking time about 1 hour. Mildly spicy. Requires an immersion blender or kitchen blender.

## Ingredients
- 1-3 jalapeño peppers
- 1 Anaheim or Cubanelle pepper
- 6 tomatillos
- 2 large chicken breasts
- 1 large white onion
- 1 head of garlic
- 3 cups chicken stock
- 2 tsp neutral oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 lime
- 1 tsp oregano
- Fresh cilantro, optional
- 3 cups white rice

## Directions
1. Rough chop the onion. Dice a little bit and set aside for a garnish.
2. Add the chicken, 1/3 of the chopped onion, 1/3 of the garlic, and the chicken broth to a small pot. Boil, then simmer covered for 45 minutes.
3. While that cooks, deseed the peppers.
4. In a sauté pan over medium-high heat, sear the peppers, tomatillos, and the rest of the garlic and chopped onion in about 2 tsp of oil. Stir the pan intermittently until the veggies are softened and seared, about 15 minutes.
5. Set aside the seared veggies. Cook the rice by your preferred method.
6. When the chicken is done simmering, remove the breasts and add the broth, onions, etc to the veggies.
7. Add to the mixture half the lime juice, and salt, pepper, oregano, and cilantro.
8. Blend until very smooth.
9. Shred the chicken breasts with forks and add to the mixture.
10. Heat the mixture, covered, over medium heat for 15 minutes.
11. Serve over rice and garnish with diced onion and lime juice.

## Notes
You can use jarred minced garlic instead of fresh, just delay adding it when you char the veggies because it will burn easily.
