## Ingredients

- 1 lb tri-color rotini
- italian dressing
- extras
  - cubed low-moisture mozzarella
  - frozen peas
  - shredded chicken

## Instructions

1. Cook rotini in well salted water according to box directions. While rotini cooks, prepare your extras.
2. Drain pasta and rinse twice in cold water to remove starch and stop carryover cooking.
3. In a large bowl combine rotini and extras. Add italian dressing, at least 8 oz. Mix and serve or refrigerate.

## Notes

At first we called this "worm salad" but this proved off-putting, and we needed a new name. We had recently learned about the [1521 Diet of Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diet_of_Worms) where Martin Luther was summoned to defend or recant his beliefs, so we called it "Luther salad" instead.

The base salad already covers elements of [salt, fat, acid, and heat](https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/), so your extras are mostly for texture, leaving lots of room for variations:

### Vegan / healthy:
- halved cherry tomatoes
- slivered sweet peppers
- paysanne cucumber

### Italian:
- halved cherry tomatoes
- sliced black olives, drained
- cubed cheese
- chopped pepperoni

## Nutrition Information

This is less a recipe and more a category of foods. It has a pound of pasta, a good amount of oil, and some protein. So, kinda high on carbs but not the worst thing. No label for this one.
