            QI Path is a startup offering a risk analysis platform. This
            platform helps decision makers in a variety of industries accurately
            assess risk, so they can make decisions with an awareness of hidden
            vulnerabilities and minimize quality and safety issues. This role
            also re-connects me with a college friend!

            Capabuild is a web and mobile platform for disaster recovery
            companies. This role was an unexpectedly great fit for some
            technologies I used in side projects: THREE.js and SVG. Here I
            worked with other experienced engineers building new things and
            continuously balancing speed and sustainability. Startup life is
            exciting! Priorities can change quickly, and in this role I could
            see every day how my work and execution could help our customers,
            and ultimately make the business a success. In this role I learned
            to accept and also pay down tech debt, and experienced the value of
            investing time into a good development environment.

            This role was at the intersection of many interests, including
            learning, communication, and decentralized solutions. Here I learned
            to own, plan, and solve larger and less-well-defined tasks. Prenda
            has an excellent and intentional culture that fosters humility and
            recognizes others' humanity.

            Back in the corporate world, using my experience to develop React
            projects in an agile environment. I began building my mentoring and
            team management abilities, as well as sharpening my JavaScript and
            React skills.

            interesting places to represent Dash or to meet up worldwide with
            other developers. My focus here was on web development, React Native
            app development, and JavaScript API testing and documentation.

            building a skillset focused around my strengths and interests.
            Outside of work, I began deeply researching cryptocurrencies and
            economics and using open source web development tools for personal
            projects.

            Also, shortly after moving for this job, I met my wife!

            remote learning, software assistance, and classroom technology. This

            had an extensive game collection and we used to play until late at
            night.
