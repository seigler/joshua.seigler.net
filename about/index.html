My parents homeschooled us, and the drive this gave me to learn new things and try them out has been a big help in my life. I’m naturally introverted, but I can present as extroverted: I love connecting with people, but quiet time to myself is how I recharge.</p><p>After college I took some time figuring out what being an adult looked like for me. In 2010 after some priceless education in communication (thanks to a <em>Dish Network</em> tech support job) and conflict resolution (thanks to my housemates at the time) I started my first engineering job up in Connecticut.</p><p>Straight away I met my wife Sara. We started dating and it was clear we were compatibly weird. Pretty soon we got married. We like board games, food trucks, black cats, mini golf, and scenic road trips.</p><p>One job led to another, and we moved around between Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts. In 2017 I took a risk and started working remotely for a cryptocurrency company. Remote work was a big adjustment, but that unique role had lots of opportunities for travel and proved to be a good preparation for working remotely in smaller companies.</p><p>The societal metamorphosis of 2019-2021 came at a time when I was also exploring a values shift, from politics as a source-of-truth back to faith, and I started trying to <a href="/posts/embracing-mysticism">learn to see the world mystically</a>. This began a change in my orientation that is still playing out.</p><p>In my next few roles, I found that I have a taste for the laser focus and fast pace of startups. I like building exciting new things, talking to customers, owning whole sections of the product, juggling priorities, and balancing clean perfection against shipping quickly.</p><p>I don’t know what tomorrow holds, but I’m sure it’s going to be great.</p><h2 id="timeline" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#timeline" aria-hidden="true"></a> Timeline</h2><section><h3 id="2025-present"><a class="header-anchor" href="#2025-present" aria-hidden="true"></a>Senior Frontend Developer @ <a href="https://www.qipath.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QI Path</a><aside>2025-present</aside></h3><p>QI Path is a startup offering a risk analysis platform.
