      <p>
        I read this heady tome in college. I think I‚Äôve completed it three
        times? It alternates between whimsical stories and theory, building a
        case that thought and meaning are emergent properties of the brain. It
        deals heavily with the idea of self-reference, which is the main theme
        uniting the three people in the title. Although he discounts the
        possibility of the immaterial aspect of reality as unknowable,
        Hofstadter introduced me to many interesting ideas and his book is a
        delightful journey, if you are prepared for it.

      <p>
        These stories contain so much richness. One theme that stuck with me
        emerges in <em>Out of the Silent Planet</em> and is repeated in
        <em>Perelandra</em>: that good things can be spoiled by overconsumption.
        Something that is pleasant or satisfying stands by itself, and doesn‚Äôt
        need to be repeated or hoarded. In fact, the drive to capture,
        concentrate, and control pleasant things can cheapen them, and could be
        at the root of many of our troubles.

      <p>
        This book painted for me a vivid picture of the mechanics of selfish and
        self-centered thinking. It describes in detail the ways that we blind
        ourselves, especially in interpersonal communication. The result of
        internalizing the concepts in this book is a sort of secular elaboration
        of ‚ÄúLove your neighbor‚Äù, but even though it misses (or omits?
        subtracts?) the spiritual core of things, it still rings quite true and
        the tools found in this book and others from the Arbinger Instutute are
        fantastically valuable.<br />

      </h3>
      <p>
        This book synthesizes many pieces of the zeitgeist as I have seen it
        develop in my life. It touches on nihilism, the charismatic movement,
        yoga, eastern and new-age spirituality, and the UFO phenomenon. All
        these things are contextualized into a movement towards an upcoming
        religious synthesis, and contrasted with eastern Orthodoxy. Fr. Seraphim
        has a clear, academic writing style which I found easy to read, and this
        book answered many questions I had not even thought to ask. I also
        recommend his book/pamphlet

          >Nihilism: The Root of the Revolution of the Modern Age</a

        and

          >The Soul After Death</a

        have not witnessed directly.

        A sympathetic main character, heaps of style, a hacker aesthetic, an
        evocative and lived-in setting, and non-stop action. This book magnified
        my love of the written word as a literal creative force. Digital reality
        and baseline reality are both shaped by language, but in different ways,
        and this story explores that distinction vigorously and memorably.

        This was my first programming book. My grandfather Clarence gave it to

        managed to make a program that produced ‚Äúmusic‚Äù, a random sequence of
        tones. I was hooked.
